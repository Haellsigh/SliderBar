## What's that

It's a keyboard slider that connects to your computer using USB.
Depending on the plugins you loaded using the desktop application, you can use your slider to execute some actions.
Here are some examples:
- Switch chrome tabs easily in one swipe.
- Switch between opened applications.
- Scroll through a window.
- Control sliders and other things in applications like Photoshop or After Effects.


## Quick start

### Get started as a user

Too early in the development for that.
